# Dingo Drum
Developers: Anthony Reynolds, Zumin Yu, Todd Yu, Hardeep Singh

### Project Description
As part of the Coder Academy Hackathon, we decided to build a Drum kit. We were keen to use an API to fetch the required sounds, however we weren't able to find a suitable API and settled for using audio files.

We decided to open the project up to include animal sounds in the spirit of Team Dingo, thus creating a page for the drum kit and another for Animal Sounds.
